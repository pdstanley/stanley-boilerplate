# Stanley-Boilerplate

A stanley-llc boilerplate server template generator. Proprietary and of great excellence. #MAGA

Before getting started:
> create a GitHub repo for the project needing to be on the server

> have that repo's SSH address handy

> know your final project name/domain

> know your aws elastic ip public domain

> copy the HTTPS git clone address for THIS repo and have the GitHub password handy

Once you've done that:
> cd to desired boilerplate install directory

> sudo yum install git

> sudo git clone https://github.com/pdstanley/stanley-boilerplate.git

> bash stanley-boilerplate/boilerplate.sh

Enjoy!
