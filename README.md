# Stanley-Boilerplate

A stanley-llc boilerplate server template generator. Proprietary and of great excellence. #MAGA

Before getting started:
> create a GitHub repo for the project being deployed on the new server

> have that repo's GitHub SSH address handy

> know your final project name/web domain

> know your aws elastic ip public domain

> finally, copy the HTTPS git clone address for THIS repo now and have overall GitHub password handy

Once you've done that:
> cd to desired boilerplate bash script install directory

> sudo yum install git

> sudo git clone https://github.com/pdstanley/stanley-boilerplate.git

> bash stanley-boilerplate/boilerplate.sh

> follow the prompts from there...

Enjoy!
